Dear AppStore review team, hello.
I received an email about my app review rejection, the content is probably ``‘The review of your app is taking longer than expected…’ This is my first time submitting an app in the AppStore, I am very excited and happy !  If it is found that there are any abnormal problems in the submitted application, I think I will be happy to actively cooperate with the rectification, and look forward to your reply. Good luck!
